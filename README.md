##What is RedBot?

Redbot is a Discord chat bot originally created by Alex Massenzio. RedBot was designed from the ground up to support running the Computer & Console Gaming Society (C2GS) at Stevens Institute of Technology. This means the bot needs to have Challonge support, a comprehensive array of administrative tools, and of course your miscellaneous functions (roll, ping, games, etc). The bot is currently in early development, so it is missing some of these features.
